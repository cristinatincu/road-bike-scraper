# Road bikes scraper
Road bikes scraper aims to a database with road bike models provided.
The information about each road bike is obtained by scraping five different online bike shops. 
The algorithm finds similar bikes from different websites based on their name. 
Next, each available color-size combination for each item is added to database as a separate comparison, in order to provide best possible comparison.
The result includes comparison not only of different retailers, but also provides prices for different specifications of the same bike.
